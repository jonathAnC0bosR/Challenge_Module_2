# Challenge Module 2

## Description.

This is the Challenge of the Module 2. Is a portfolio that links some of the work I've made. Some links are empty because since I'm learning to code I don't have a lot of projects. Throught the elaboration of this project I learned how to use grid, which for a beginner it was a bit challenging, also I applied some media queries so the page is responsive to differents screen sizes. Also applied a background image effect when a hover is made. 

## Instalation.

To see the project working all you need to have is vs code and an internet navigator so you can open the links.

## Usage.

As a developer we can use this portfolio to show the recruiters our work and projects. It is a very useful way to present us. You can use this code to show your own work!
